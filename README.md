## Overview

Network Packet Sniffer is built in Java and leverages the Jpcap library to capture network packets. It can analyze the captured packets to provide insights into the protocols used and memory usage.

## Features

- Capture network packets in real-time.
- Analyze application layer protocols.
- Display statistics such as:
- Number of packets per protocol.
- Percentage of packets per protocol.
- Total packet size per protocol.
- Percentage of packet size per protocol.
- Monitor and display free memory statistics.

## Requirements

- Java JDK (version 8 or higher)
- Jpcap library
